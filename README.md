## x) Read and summarize (with some bullet points)
Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (A colored HTML version), chapters


* Bitcoin was created as an method to perform transactions via internet without inteferance from financial insitutions. Financial institutions limit transaction sizes and apply costs on all online transactions and creators of Bitcoin wanted to find a solution to that. There is also a possibility of cyber security risks for traditional transactions through internet and Bitcoin aims to resolve that.
* Bitcoin's working logic is based on a chain of electronic signatures. Verification of autenticity is done in chain and there is also a central authority or "mint" that confirms the steps in the chain of verification. This verification method is to ensure that there is no double-spent.
* Timestamp server can be user as a verification method for Bitcoin transactions. Timestamp server compares block of hash information and it's timestamm and confirms the chain of hashes and timestamps. This chain of hashes and confirmations is unbreakable and secure.
* Trying to get into the chain of transactions will require immense amount of CPU and electricity and that is not a viable solution because those would gtake more moeny than generate it.


## Wallet. Create a BitCoin testnet wallet.'

Installed Coinomi test wallet

Got into login site and after seeing these keywords,  I immediately removed the tool from my PC. This kind of language and culture is not something I appreciate and support and will not test it further.

Tried installing Bitbay wallet according to instructions.

I also tried to create Coinbase wallet but I don't want to give out my personal information for a tool that I have ethical issues with. I will not continue this task forward.

## Tasks b to F

c) Giveway. Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digists are 73.
d) Recycle. Move the testnet money back to the same faucet you got it from.
e) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting, such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.

Accessesd the link per instructions: https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/. Following page appeared.

I had no idea what to do for steps B to E. I apologize for this but I cannot perform these tasks.


## RogeCoin. Critically comment on Honest Ads: If Cryptocurrency Was Honest (Video, about 5 minutes). Identify and list arguments made. Provide commentary to support and challenge each of the claims. If you can, provide references or real life examples to your claims. (This task does not require tests with a computer.)

I'm not familiar of this Roger person but based on the comments on Youtube, this guy is fluent in sarcasm. Perhpas too fluent because it was quite difficult to find what he is saying as everything he is saying is covered with thick layer of said sarcasm. I'm hoping I was able to extract correct points and that he is actually addressing these issues:
 
* **Bitcoin has harmful effect on environment and use of Bitcoin and similar technologies increases climate change, pollution and consumption of water**
  Many sources state that use of Bitcoin and similar technologies is harmful to environment and to earth and species that habit it. According to a research made by United Nations University, Bitcoin has a lot of negative effects on environment. Bitcoing mining depends on fossil fuels and increased need for CPU's and their processing power requires immense amount of virgin materials. Bitcoin minin also has impact on on water and land. According to UNU, "uring 2020-2021 period, the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 Terawatt hours of electricity". This means that mining Bitcoin globally consumed same amount of energy than the whole country of Pakistan (230 million people). Bitcoin water footprint was same as yearly water needs for 300 million people in rural sub-Saharan Africa. (UNU)
  
 As the mining of bitcoin is not decreasing (on the contrary, it is increasing yearly), I think it is OK to say that ining Bitcoin is unethical. While the tecnology as technlogy is interesting, it's effect on global well-being of species is considerably bad.

 I think after this statement nothing else is as important  but we can state few other arguments:

* **Bitcoin is a collective hallucination for earning money**
While Bitcoin as a technology is interesting and can have interesting applications and benefits to security development, the way how Bitcoin is right now, it is more like a multi-level marketin scheme. People invest in Bitcoin because they don't understand it but are sold the "truth" of it being valuable option. 
  
* **Bitcoin is vulnerable to human error**
  In the video, it is addresses that there is a possibility for a person to get weatlhy by mining Bitcoin but that many failures related to Bitcoin are due to human error such as losing your Bitcoin wallet's password, storing your Bitmoney in third party provider solutions that are vulnerable to can lead to hackers hacking your Bitmoney out and you also have limited control over your bitmoney and can lose your Bitmoney access due to platform policies.

(Medium)

* **Bitcoin cannot be used in real-life needs**
* Heroin and feet pics



I do have to say that kittens sneezing is adorable BUT how this person presented kitten sneezing is an utter lie because that was not a sneeze, that was a meow. But it was a cute meow anyhow.
